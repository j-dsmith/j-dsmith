# Jamey Smith  
**Senior Frontend Engineer — React, TypeScript, UI Platforms**

I build scalable, design-system-driven UI platforms for complex, cross-platform products.

At **KorTerra**, I lead frontend architecture and **UI platform modernization** across an **Electron + React + Capacitor** application used on Windows, Android, and mobile. My work spans **Redux architecture, shared state systems, and component-library design**, including a major modernization of the **ticket detail experience** — introducing **modular tabbed layouts, pinned fields, and mobile-optimized toolbars** to improve how users interact with core product data.

A core part of my role is designing **how UI is built**: eliminating style-specificity wars, removing `!important`-driven tech debt, and creating **design-system-driven widgets** that become a single source of truth for teams building new features across **Ionic, Material UI, and custom components**.

Previously at **Harbor Foods Group**, I helped scale a data-heavy enterprise platform from ~300 to nearly 2,000 users by replacing hard-coded UI with reusable Angular components, introducing a **WCAG-compliant OKLCH color system**, and aligning frontend and backend development across **Angular and .NET**.
