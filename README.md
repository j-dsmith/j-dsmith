# Jamey Smith  
**Senior Frontend Engineer — React, TypeScript, UI Systems**

I build scalable, design-driven frontend systems for complex, cross-platform products.

Currently at **KorTerra**, I lead frontend architecture and UX modernization across an **Electron + React** application used on Windows, Android, and mobile. My work spans **Redux architecture, shared state systems, component design, and full dashboard redesigns**, including migrating legacy Ionic UI to **Material UI** and delivering responsive, accessible experiences across platforms.

Previously at **Harbor Foods Group**, I helped scale a data-heavy enterprise platform from ~300 to nearly 2,000 users by replacing hard-coded UI with reusable Angular components, introducing a **WCAG-compliant OKLCH color system**, and improving how frontend and backend teams collaborate across **Angular and .NET**.

## 🧪 What you'll find here

Most of my day-to-day work lives in private enterprise codebases, but this GitHub is where I explore and document:

- Frontend architecture patterns  
- UI system and component design  
- State management strategies  
- Experiments and prototypes  
- Tools and workflows that improve frontend developer velocity  

These projects reflect **how I think and build**, not just finished products.
